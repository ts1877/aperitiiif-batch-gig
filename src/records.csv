This “crucifix” is actually composed of golden cubes that are repeated in four smaller cubes in front of Christ and the squares on the ground upon which the female devotional figure (likely Mary Magdalene) stands. While Christ’s face is turned away from the viewer and his body floats in front of the cross, the tensed fingers of both hands suggest martyrdom, and the gestures are emphasized by the shadows they cast on the crucifix.
